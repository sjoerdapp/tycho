# Tycho

Tycho is a change management service, with the ability to store
operational events and query them via tags or within time ranges.

Tycho provides the ability to describe relationships between events
as well, by specifying an ID of a parent event from which the child
event was spawned.

Tycho is a service from the orbital group at Zillow.

User Guide

Tycho is a service designed for durable storage and fast querying of events that indicate operational change. Examples of such events include:

deployments
work-in-action (upgrading a host, network card)
AB bucket changes
In short, any change that can affect the behavior of a service.

Once this data is in Tycho, you can perform various queries of the data such as:

querying a single event
querying a series of events based on tags and time ranges when the event occurred
querying for a tree of events: if a parent-child relationship is specified in events, Tycho can construct a tree and return the full tree of results.
Tycho is primarily an API, and the primary unit of data is an event. An event might look something like:

{
    "id": "my-unique-event-id",
    "start_time": "2018-12-31T18:38:52.345000+00:00",
    "end_time": "2018-12-31T18:58:52.345000+00:00",
    "description": "deploy of service foo in environment bar",
    "detail_urls": {
      "deploy": "http://deploy-service/deploy/1"
    },
    "tags": {
      "source": ["deploy"],
      "service": ["foo"],
      "environment": ["bar"]
    }
}
To describe each component in detail:

id: a string that unqiuely identifies the event. If omitted, a uuid4 string will be constructed.
start_time/ end_time: ISO 8601 timestamps of when the event began and ended.
description: a human-readable description of the event
detail_urls: a map string/string pairs, with the values being urls.
tags: a map of string, list of string pairs that are used to index the event.
Submitting Events

API documentation and a playground are provided at /api/. However, a simple explanation is given here.

Tycho supports two primary APIs for submitting events:

PUT to /api/v1/events/, to create new events
POST to /api/v1/events/, to update existing events
The body should contain the event itself.

Querying Events

Events can be queried by time range and by tags. An example using both looks like:

/api/v1/event/?tag=environment:production&tag=service:foo&frm=2018-12-31T09:09:25.991Z&page=1

This will return all events that are tagged with environment:production and service:foo since December 31st, 2018.

Specifying Parent-Child Relationships

Oftentimes operational events are automated, such as deploys through a continuous delivery system such as Jenkins or Spinnaker. In those case it may also be valuable to describe a chain of events that caused the deploy to occur.

To facilitate this, events are able to pass in a parent_id. For example, you could provide the user-driven commit and the linked deploy object by posting the following:

Parent Event:

{
  "event": {
      "id": "user-commit-hash",
      "start_time": "2018-12-31T18:18:52.345000+00:00",
      "end_time": "2018-12-31T18:28:52.345000+00:00",
      "description": "",
      "detail_urls": {
        "commit": "http://github.com/deploy/1"
      },
      "tags": {
        "source": ["github"],
        "author": ["myemail@example.com"]
      }
  }
}
Child Event:

{
  "event": {
    "id": "my-deploy-event",
    "parent_id": "user-commit-hash",
    "start_time": "2018-12-31T18:38:52.345000+00:00",
    "end_time": "2018-12-31T18:58:52.345000+00:00",
    "description": "deploy of service foo in environment bar",
    "detail_urls": {
      "deploy": "http://deploy-service/deploy/1"
    },
    "tags": {
      "source": ["deploy"],
      "service": ["foo"],
      "environment": ["bar"]
    }
  }
}
You can then visualize the tree at /event/user-commit-hash/.

In addition, there are various APIs to help you audit event relationships further. Also available in the API documentation, but a few examples are:

/api/v1/event/<event_id>/children -> see immediate children of event
/api/v1/event/<event_id>/impact -> recursively iterate and produce all children
/api/v1/event/<event_id>/trace -> return the current event, and all parents
